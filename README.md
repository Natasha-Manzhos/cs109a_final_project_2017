Final project working on ADNI (Alzheimer's disease) dataset for class CS109a

ADNI Alzheimer's dataset
Alzheimer's disease (AD) is characterized by 2 major diagnostic features: pathological changes in the brain namely beta-amyloid placques and deterioration of the mental state. Neither of these features is sufficient but both are necessary for a definitive AD diagnosis. In this project, we will focus on these 2 features separately and 1.) try to predict CSF beta-amyloid level from gene expression data (mainly by Ning Shen) and 2.) try to predict the mental state from brain imaging data (mainly by Lars von Buchholtz). 

PART 1: Predicting beta-amyloid levels from gene expression data
The original DREAM challenge failed in predicting beta-amyloid levels given the data provided. Therefore, we decided to include micro-array gene expression data in our attempt to predict beta-amyloid levels. If it is possible to predict beta-amyloid levels in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) from gene expression in blood samples, this would provide a much less invasive way to diagnose amyloid placques and the identified signature genes could be used as clinical biomarkers.

PART 2: Predicting mental state (MMSE) from brain imaging data (MRI)
Since the psychological pathology develops relatively late in the disease progression, it would be advantageous to be able to predict the mental state (MMSE score) from MRI brain imaging data which is routinely acquired in clinical settings. We downloaded the data for this challenge from https://ida.loni.usc.edu/pages/access/studyData.jsp?categoryId=43&subCategoryId=94
